		"abstract": "Nowadays the problem of microplastics in fluids like drinkable water is a huge topic with a lot of new publications and studies about the amount, types and risks of it for animals, environment and humans. The `Plastractor` is a device which shall extract microplastics from fluids easily via magnets. Therefore the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum `magneticum` was obtained. It is genetically modified to build magnetosomes; small magnetic and vesicle-like particles, with plastic binding peptides on its membrane. For modification we use E. coli BW29427 which transfers the needed plasmid to Rhodospirillum rubrum `magneticum` via conjugation. Two different plastic binding peptides are used, `Tachystatin A2` (TA2) and `liquid chromatography peak I` (LCI), fused with two different fluorescent proteins to enable the detection of the bound particles. Thus the device will be able to extract the plastics that are bound to magnetosomes and detect it by fluorescence.",

Even with today`s technologies, improved efficacy is necessary as the demand for recombinant proteins is increasing  it has been estimated that within the next ten years half of all medicines developed will be biopharmaceuticals.Our iGEM project introduces VibXPRESSO - Vibrio natriegens with Xtreme PRotein Expression and Secretion Optimization. We harness the gram-negative bacterium`s generation time of under 10 minutes to rapidly produce large amounts of protein for efficient purification. This is achieved via the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, that secretes proteins into the bacterium`s periplasm. By environmental modifications we have increased the outer membrane leakiness ofV. natriegens, to direct proteins from the periplasm into the growth medium for easier protein harvest. As a proof of concept, we compared the yield of human growth hormone between V. natriegens WT ATCC 14048 and our modified VibXPRESSO strain.",

However, the analyte binding antibodies in conventional immunoassays are randomly immobilized onto a test surface blocking some binding sites from the analytes. When the concentration of a disease marker as the analyte is below the detection limit or the sensitivity, the signal could be improved by orienting the antibodies. Our objective was to orientate a digoxigenin binding Fab fragment of the antibody by incorporating a p-azido-L-phenylalanine, an unnatural amino acid with click chemistry properties. As a control, we used a chemically treated Fab including azide in random locations. The Fabs were immobilized onto DBCO coated magnetic beads and the bound fluorescently labeled digoxigenin was measured with flow cytometry. According to the results, orientation improved the signal and made the test surface more homogeneous.",

VenomXL incorporates the power of the post-translational modification processes primarily methylation or acetylation on critical locaion of the active polypeptide of the LTNF. The polypeptide is circularized, a process that comprises of adding cysteine amino acids to both ends of a polypeptide chain; triggering the formation of a disulphide bridge, ultimately leading to a circular structure, hence the name circularization. Circularized proteins are known for not only greater stability but also greater efficacy of the protein, thereby improving its shelf life and lowering the required dosage for treatment, ultimately providing a more efficient bioproduct.",

Our project aims to create a platform for the evolution of optimised aptamers, in E. coli cells. The evolution of our aptamer sequence is achieved through the interaction of three modules: the aptamer module, the mutagenesis module and the selection module. The aptamer module contains the aptamer sequence connected to a ribozyme. When the aptamer binds to its target, the ribozyme is activated, cleaving a Small Transcription Activating RNA. The STAR enables the transcription of an antibiotic resistance gene, used for selection. Mutagenesis is performed by the EvolvR system.

In the FlyGEM project, we took advantage of the Bacillus thuringiensis israeliensis (Bti), a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that produces insecticidal toxins and virulence factors that selectively target the larval mosquito stages. We genetically engineered a bacterium that expresses Bti toxin in the gut microbiome of adult mosquitoes. Mosquitoes fed by Bti-toxin expressing bacteria were not affected, however the bacteria are delivered to the eggs and the expressed Bti is toxic for the hatching and nearby larvae.

In a novel mode of action, our Troygenics enter these pathogens via endocytosis and deliver a Cell Death Inducing System (CeDIS). Troygenics consist of modified M13 coat-proteins assembled by Escherichia coli and contain ssDNA encoding the specific CeDIS based on Cas13a. Pathogen-specific ligands fused to the coat proteins enhance uptake via endocytosis. We incorporated sophisticated biosafety mechanisms to achieve selective transformation of the targeted pathogen. Among other methods, we demonstrated the functionality of the Troygenics applying a self-developed low-cost microfluidic system.In conclusion, we engineered an innovative platform technology customizable to target various eukaryotic pathogens.",

A bilateral switch is put in control of the pathways, conferring the microbe an exquisite trait to express either pathway at an optimal time according to the changing chemical environment inside digestive track.

As a solution, we propose a novel, easy-to-use diagnostic test detecting mycolactone, the toxin excreted by the causative agent Mycobacterium ulcerans, in a patient`s sample. The molecular mechanism is based on a riboswitch which, in the presence of mycolactone, specifically induces chromoprotein expression in an engineered Escherichia coli strain, generating a simple visual read-out. As an alternative to GMOs, the test may also be used as cell-free system.

Astaxanthin, one of the strongest antioxidants in nature, has broad market prospects and high commercial value, providing us with an ideal destination of stalks utilization. In our project, E. coli cells are engineered to consume cellulose as the carbon source and produce astaxanthin. To achieve this goal, three cellulose-degrading enzymes are anchored to E. coli cells` outer membranes, while an astaxanthin synthesis pathway is constructed by transferring six additional enzymes to E. coli cells.

Resulting intermediates are ultimately employed anaerobically to convert into dissolved hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen synthesis is also fueled by pathways that metabolize n-chained hydrocarbons. HORIZON 2.0 also utilizes pathways for the degradation of salicylate and phthalate, compounds that resulted from previous PAH degradation constructs but are unusable by E. coli. To modulate between the various conditions for degradation and synthesis, a positively regulated magnesium riboswitch and novel synthetic CRISPRi operators under riboswitch regulation were designed for use as synthetic operators.

Upon the extraction of the DNA from a saliva sample, Cas12a scans the DNA searching for a complementary sequence to the gRNA. If complementary binding occurs, a reaction complex forms and triggers an indiscriminate cleavage activity. Through this, a single-stranded DNA linking the reporter and its quencher degrades and allows the emission of fluorescence. Then, CASPRE`s developed, hand-held device and user-friendly application work in tandem to detect and interpret the emitted fluorescence producing a +/- diagnoses.Within a few minutes, we become a step closer to a more aware community.",

Using this technique, the midgut bacteria of the bee are engineered to express a cytochrome p450, rendering the bee resistant to the insecticide. By attaching the reporter phoA to the insecticide-resistance gene, CYP6AY1, found in Nilaparvata lugens, the expression of the protein can be monitored. The signal sequence pelB is used to secrete the protein into the bee gut, where it can metabolize the imidacloprid. Once this system successfully functions in-vitro, the transgenic bacteria can be introduced to the bee orally and monitored for significant effects.

CU team is working on two approaches: Accumulating the salt inside the microbial cell by improving the sequestration of sodium and chloride ions and modifying the cells not to release the salts, and overcome the toxic effect of salts on the cell by expressing osmoprotectant and by increasing vacuoles uptake of the salts.The second approach is to synthesize Cell-free Na and Cl binding proteins to avoid the drawbacks of introducing modified microorganisms into the water. The system is meant to be integrated as a pre-treatment step in the current desalination infrastructure.",

		"abstract": "Monoclonal antibody (MAb) therapies are a new frontier of pharmaceuticals used for treating a variety of illnesses such cancer. However, the administration of MAbs may be associated with an overactive immune response that cause extremely dangerous side effects. To help solve this problem we created an antibody kill switch in which a small molecule can quickly turn the antibody `off` in the body and mitigate these side effects.Using computer protein modeling, we engineered an antibody with two compartments, the first consists of the variable antibody domains while the second is our kill switch. This kill switch region is AraC, a bacterial transcription factor that forms a homodimer that dramatically changes its dimer orientation when bound to the small molecule arabinose. In our design, when arabinose binds the AraC compartment, it pulls apart the homodimer, rendering our antibody nonfunctional. This concept could create a new generation of safer monoclonal antibodies.",

Using E. coli transformed with plasmids expressing PETase, an enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis that degrades polyethylene terephtalate (PET), this project`s purpose was to develop a more thermostable and efficient enzyme to combat this microplastic pollution. Nine E. coli strains were engineered, each with unique mutations to alter the PETase activity and thermodynamic properties. Growth assays were conducted at different temperatures, with and without the presence of the PET substrate. Protein expression analysis of the mutants revealed a band for every strain at approximately 31 kDa, the expected size of PETase. Using a plate reader, absorption of the samples was measured and peaks at 260 nm were compared to detect the presence of MHET, a downstream product of PET degradation. With success, a faster and more efficient PETase enzyme could eventually be the solution to end the plastic pollution problem.",

However, a significant problem arises when excess amounts of fluoride are present in drinking water. Consumption of water containing high amounts of fluoride can contribute to dental fluorosis, which manifests in children as hypomineralization of the enamel. The previous East Chapel Hill iGEM teams had attempted to develop a fluoride biosensor using previously characterized fluoride riboswitches. This system, known as the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase operon (CHOP), allows for the transcription of the antibiotic chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in high amounts of fluoride. Thus, when high amounts of fluoride are present, bacterial growth can be observed in the presence of chloramphenicol. In previous years, we encountered issues forming reliable conclusions from our results when using plating assays. This year, we aimed to develop a more throughput liquid media assay which has allowed for quantitative and more accurate characterization of CHOP.",

		"abstract": "Utilizing bacterial cells for their capacity to serve as computational or memory-like devices has potential applications in fields such as healthcare and biotechnology. Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events (SCRIBE) uses a reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce single stranded DNA which can be incorporated into the host-genome during DNA replication using the Lambda-Red system which results in a mutation within the bacterial chromosome. This SCRIBE system can be applied to a large population of cells in order to measure the amount of a stimulus by sequencing DNA to quantify the number of times the mutations occur in relation to the entire population. The UF iGEM team seeks to couple the SCRIBE system with the DNA nuclease activity of the Cas9 protein to cut and kill the chromosome of the bacteria with wild type DNA, thereby killing the cells without mutations.",

Most approaches limit themselves to the 20 canonical L-amino acids. However, their stereochemical counterparts, D-amino acids, harbor an immense potential. When assembled into peptides these cannot be recognized by the cellular machineries, thus evading proteolytic breakdown and immunological recognition. This makes them perfect candidates for therapeutics. By establishing a multitude of tools we empower D-amino acids for synthetic biology. We demonstrate the potency of mirror-image phage display by identifying D-ligands towards a toxin of the multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus. We create finDr, a software to perform this method in silico for any target enabling fast, cost-effective prediction of D-ligands. Alongside chemical synthesis, we implement methods to synthesize, incorporate and detect D-amino acids in bacteria. Altogether, we lay the foundations for advancing the use of D-amino acids in cells or as therapeutics.",

These steps will be carried out iteratively, generating a random mutation library of the target with high efficiency as mutations accumulate along with bacterial growth.

We designed and constructed a resolution extensible analog-digital converter (ADC), which converts the consecutive analog quantities (the strength of an inducible promoter) into discrete digital signals (indicated by different chromoproteins), allowing the digitized processing and storage of signals. Beyond the common use of recombinase system as simple response to two input levels, our project achieves modifying and utilizing the response interval of this system.

It shows circRNA has a potential ability that it can skip the rate-limiting process of the central dogma of molecular biology, binding ribosomes to mRNA. However, with conventional circRNA, functional protein cannot be translated because protein aggregation quickly occurs. Therefore, we decided to use translation-coupling system, which is found in operons of bacteria to produce monomer protein from circRNA. With applying it to circRNA, ribosomes repeat translation-coupling phenomenon in circRNA and are expected to express monomer protein.

Additionally, if animal products contaminated with antibiotics are consumed by humans, there is a risk that the consumer`s intestinal microbiota will be damaged or create their own resistant bacteria.In light of this, antibiotic detection and monitoring in the environment and in animal products are of very current relevance. In our project, we`ve used synthetic biology to develop a bacterial system that can sense tetracycline and respond to its presence by producing a non-toxic biological pigment. The resulting system produces a visible colour change after induction with water, dairy, or meat samples that contain tetracycline.

As a proof-of-concept design, we will focus on detecting PCBs, a group of manmade aromatic chemicals that had been widely used in many industrial processes. We will insert a previously discovered PCB aptamer either into the 5`-UTR of a bacterial reporter gene or downstream of the start codon. Aptamer binding to PCB will lead to its structural switching that leads to enhancement or reduction of gene expression. Readouts can be a reporter protein or the migration of bacteria to access the efficiency of the proposed system.",

The degradation rate of PET is significantly slow which make them extremely persistent and hard to dispose. Although PETase can biologically degrade PET, the rate of enzymatic reaction is not suitable for usage in plastic waste treatment. Therefore, creating mutants which have a higher PET degradation activity may represent an effective and a long term solution of pollution from PET. After structural studies of PETase and its mutants, we hypothesized a more hydrophobic surface and narrower substrate binding site could lead to an increase in activity due to a better substrate interaction with PET. In our study, four single or double PETase mutants are produced and their PET degrading capacity are measured by enzyme activities for para-nitrophenol (pNP)-aliphatic esters.",

We hope to silence the microcystin biosynthesis cluster(mcy) using a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) enzyme lacking endonuclease activity. When the dCas9 enzyme is co-expressed with a guide RNA(sgRNA), the dCas9-sgRNA complex specifically binds to the McyB gene and blocks transcript elongation, leading to the repression of the McyB gene without altering the chromosome of the Microcystis. Here we provide the design of a dCas9-sgRNA expression gene in a shuttle vector that can replicate in both E.coli and cyanobacteria.

Our team has combined the CRISPRi system with RNA regulators to achieve a toggle switch. The switch utilizes the catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9) to achieve targeted and reversible repression of genes via specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Alternatively, the transcription of antisense RNA (asRNAs) reverses the effect of the dCas9 modulated repression on the desired genes. This method of regulation would allow for the ability to fine-tune and easily customize the execution of highly complex genetic circuits. Using GFP and RFP in our circuit as a proof of concept, RFP is suppressed under the first inducible promoter while GFP is produced. Under the second inducible promoter, the dCas9 is unable to bind to mrfp, derepressing mrfp and suppressing GFP.",

Therefore, this system was chosen as a model for investigation.We previously demonstrated that E. coli itself could remove about 30% of copper pollutants in water after 4 hours.

The symbiotic plasmid encodes all of the known nodulation (besides NolR) and nitrogen fixation proteins, such as the very important gene nif-specific transcriptional activator (NifA). We cloned the NifA gene from Sinorhizobium fredii, constructed the over-expression vector of pHT43 and transformed into Bacillus subtilis. The NifA over-expressed Bacillus subtilis modulated the soil pH from 4.0 to over 7. It could also provide Nitrogen and improve cotton plant growth. Further research shows that it could maintain the pH about 7 in soil around tea plants and provide Nitrogen for them.",

Using the mathematical models based on the fermentation profile, the fermentation was optimized, and 15 times more γ-PGA was produced than that before. By introducing glutamate racemase gene racE under different Ptac promoter mutants, the L-glutamic acid content in γ-PGA varies from 97.1% to 36.9%.

We then tested our synthetically produced catechins on cancer cells in order to determine the antioxidant effects of the product.",

We are approaching in two ways. First, we fused protein consisting of opsin and DRD2(dopamine receptor). Light act as DRD2 agonist, thus it triggers the nigrostriatal pathway. The light increases dopamine signaling in PD patient`s brain. Second, we regulated the expression of ABAT by using the CRISPR-dCas9 system. It prevents neurodegeneration by inactivating GABA, which transmits an excessive inhibitory signal. Moreover, this system is reversible so it is capable of resolving the problem induced by GABA deficiency. If this project is fully developed and applied, it can cure not only PD but also addiction, schizophrenia, and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Immunofluorescence(IF) showed CPP-scFv(P5) can penetrate the cell membrane. Through modeling, we grafted CDR regions of anti-Ras antibody to scFv(F8) to make hyperstable scFv that can recognize Ras. We performed homology modeling of engineered scFv using Modeller and showed our model is structurally similar to anti-Ras antibody. Our experiments demonstrate hyperstable scFv with CPP can go into the cell and function in reducing conditions.

Besides the economic cost associated with these energy sources, such systems are often not considered durable.

To circumvent these issues, photosynthetic systems like cyanobacteria and algae have been gaining increasing interest for biosynthetic purposes as they require only light and CO2. With our project, OCYANO, we present two new cyanobacterial technologies for protein production. The first design comprises the production and secretion of proteins in an ultra-fast growing cyanobacterium. The second system relies on a cyanophage for the conversion of its host`s biomass to the protein of interest. Along with wet-lab exploration of these platforms, the economic and ecological relevances of both systems were investigated and compared to state of the art biosynthesis platforms.",

To address this issue, our goal is to make an eukaryotic bioluminescent system that detects stress in animals. To be more specific, if a target`s level of cortisol rises to a certain level, our system will get triggered, causing its skin to light up. This will enable people to visibly check if animals are under stress, helping them to identify and eliminate possible causes of animal stress. To achieve this, we employed a newly discovered fungal bioluminescent system to design and construct a genetic circuit that detects cellular signals. Our project also includes mathematical modeling of the bioluminescent system to reach a desired outcome. Furthermore, we intend to apply our system to humans as well and hope to provide an effective stressmanaging system for people in the future.",

Microfibers from clothes are released into wastewater and eventually flows into the ocean without being processed. Our project aims to capture microfibers from household washing machines. To achieve this, we used encapsulins - protein-made spherical nanostructures - which can be engineered to display other proteins on their surface. We designed encapsulins which display proteins binds to plastic and microorganisms found in wastewater treatment plants. We picked up some proteins as plastic-binding proteins, and compared them with each other. In our strategy, microfibers may then be bound to microorganisms through engineered encapsulins and settled in sedimentation basins. This therefore avoids the introduction of GMOs into wastewater treatment processes. Combined with plastic-digesting enzymes, we believe our approach represents an effective way to deal with a common source of microplastics.",

One interesting alternative is the use of a novel biomaterial recently found in the Humboldt squid suckerin protein. Suckerin assets unique features such as flexibility, strength and ability to self-assemble into β-sheets, making it ideal for hydrogel formation. Since molecular engineering enables cheap, fast and high-yield production within microorganisms, we thrive to produce a suckerin-based hydrogel as a donor skin substitute. Introducing a linker system enables the joining of antimicrobial peptides, numbing agents and wound healing stimulators.

We are developing an edible recombinant microalgae strain called `Algulin` that produces either an ultrastable oral insulin analog or proinsulin peptides.

We have also undertaken on-the-ground research in Cameroon, together with local people and scientists, to identify the actual needs that must be addressed and adapting the design of the final sensor to them. Our project is both interdisciplinary and intercultural, which takes us further than the simple sum of our parts.",

		"abstract": "The use of natural and sustainable inks in many different applications such as printer cartridges, pens or textile dyeing is currently limited by two important factors. On the one hand, although pigments can be extracted and purified easily from fruits or vegetables, the use of food for these purposes is not a sustainable practice. On the other hand, natural pigments are prone to oxidation, which severely affect color stability. Therefore, as a proof of concept, we propose a synthetic biology approach in which bacteria are genetically programmed to synthesize enzymes capable of catalyzing the transformation of color precursors into pigments. Oxidation of these pigments can then be prevented by either chemical or physical strategies. We explore both the use of a yeast cell-free system as a chemical anti-oxidant and the encapsulation of the resultant pigments to prevent their oxidation using physical barriers.",

The coloured proteins have hydrophobic tags that will allow them to anchor onto hair without breaking the cuticle.We have also taken this opportunity to integrate reparative and fragrant compounds to our product. Research has found that the `pepG decapeptide` can infiltrate the hair and reform disulphide bonds, effectively straightening and repairing hair.

To mitigate this, we developed a paper-based biosensor that consumers can use at home to assess their milk for spoilage. Our device detects the quorum-sensing molecules, acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), produced by spoilage bacteria, both of which increase in concentration as spoilage progresses. Our detection system visualizes high AHL levels with the expression of pigment proteins.

Here, we present a mechanism to harness cellular chemotaxis to control cellular swarming and directed movement. We engineered human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells to secrete chemokines that induce chemotaxis in unengineered neutrophils. To evaluate chemotaxis, we first differentiated HL-60 cells into chemotactic neutrophils. We then introduced chemokines produced by our engineered HEK cells and evaluated neutrophil movement utilizing several cellular migration assays.

To create our tool, we built four plasmidic constructs: each containing a sugar-responsive promoter (pLAC, pSRL, pARA or pRIB) upstream ofa fluorescent reporter protein (GFP, CFP, RFP or YFP). With these constructs, we characterized the activity of the promoters in different conditions, varying the medium composition, the concentrations of sugars, the temperature and the pH. It allowed us to build a model predicting the amount of sugar needed in the medium to trigger gene expression at a certain time and for a certain duration. This fundamental tool could be used in a wide variety of fields such as administration of medicine.",

		"abstract": "Engineered organisms are being used to solve global problems today, from cleaning up our environment to diagnosing diseases. Yet, bottlenecks in engineered microbes lie in their limited functional lifespan and inherent stochasticity. We aim to overcome these limitations by engineering an `on-off` switch for the cells, giving the ability to control their productivity and extend their productive lifespan. Aided by modelling, we developed this switch using Toxin-Antitoxin modules which target global translational process and cellular metabolism to enable dormancy. Our technology allows the insertion of different input control modules to regulate these circuits in a plug-and-play manner. To ensure the safety and retainability of our circuits, a biocontainment module was designed to prevent the unwanted spread of our modules to other organisms. Finally, we successfully demonstrated regulated and lengthened productivity by using luminescence production. Our technology thus pushes the boundaries of Synthetic Biology, bringing it closer to real world adoption.",

Our solution is to engineer a Lactobacillus reuteri probiotic chassis to detect the quorum signaling autoinducing peptide of C. difficile in the intestinal lumen. Detection uses the C. difficile two component signaling system, to induce secretion of a C. difficile-specific endolysin to cleave its cell wall and leave the remaining intestinal flora intact.

Our first method involves the cascading splicing events through our nested intein design. This involves the insertion of an orthogonal split-intein within an intein half to render it nonfunctional. This creates a multi-input AND gate that can be incorporated into a larger cellular circuit. We propose a second method in which a weakly-associating intein is connected by aflexible linker. This linker is constructed from multi-input AND gates consisting of split-intein pairs, which avoids additional disruption of the extein sequence.

		"abstract": "Every year, approximately 30 percent of rice crops across the world are damaged due to Magnaporthe oryzae, commonly known as rice blast fungus. While rice plants have receptors that sense chitin from fungal pathogens, M. oryzae secretes a chitinase to break down its own chitin before it is detected. Using this chitinase, M. oryzae is able to avoid triggering the rice`s defense mechanism that would inhibit the spread of the fungal infection. However, by preemptively exposing the rice plant to chitin it is possible to trigger the rice`s defense mechanisms before M. oryzae can suppress detection methods. In order to accomplish this, we worked to develop a method of exposing rice plants to chitin by introducing NodC, a chitin synthase homolog, into Pseudomonas fluorescens, a bacterium that naturally lives on rice leaves.

		"abstract": "When farmers spray phosphate fertilizer on crops, the excess will leach to the underground, contaminating the water and resulting eutrophication which threatens many lives. Fertilizer pollution spreads globally, especially in developing countries where agriculture still holds economic dominance, although some countries have started to deal with the problem.We find that acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme which catalyzes the reaction converting P fertilizer to phosphoric acid. Therefore, we can use acetylcholinesterase to measure the concentration of Phosphate in water by detecting the level of PH. Our goal in this research is to produce acetylcholinesterase by bioengineering. We insert the ACHE gene in mouse into multi-clone vector pGEX-4T-1 with restrictive enzymes PluTI and BspQI, and then fuse it with E.coli. After expressing AChE, we assembly it into a PH device which corresponds P-fertilizer level with PH. In this way, people could learn the level of fertilizer pollution in water.",

HucR is a transcriptional factor that senses UA. We combined HucR with the amplifier, Rin-p80α, so that the bacteria could sense the stimulation of uric acid and send signals to us. We also identified the gene downstream HucR operon as uricase gene smUOX-Flag, which degraded uric acid at high a concentration. So far, our UA explorer can sense to UA, and our UA terminator can break down uric acid. In all, our work offers help for defending such diseases.",

Transfection efficiency of commercially available liposomal reagents is frequently associated with cellular toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. These complications, in addition to its high cost, augment the unmet need for a cost-effective and less-toxic transfection reagent. Cell-Penetrating Peptides (CPPs) are short (<30 amino acids) linear peptides that facilitate the cellular uptake of diverse macromolecules. The broad range of their cellular targets and their limited toxicity qualify them as ideal carriers for cargo delivery. Our current project involves the novel application of a synthetic CPP for the direct delivery of interfering RNA in the context of transient gene silencing. The selected CPP delivers the un-bound cargo through pore formation and gets selectively targeted for proteasomal degradation, thus averting the possibilities of carrier induced autophagy and cytotoxicity.",

P. putida, with its known root interactions with Arabidopsis thaliana, was utilized to promote plant growth through the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, and trehalose synthase. A program that couples genetic algorithms and NUPACK was created to design and optimize low temperature RNA thermometers.

In the microbiological industry like fermentation, the bacteria co-culture is promising. However, it is difficult for people to achieve dynamic regulation in the co-culture system. This year, we build a LCBC system (Light Controlled Bacteria Co-culture). In the system, we use the lights with different colors to regulate and control the amount and ratio of the bacteria. This system consists of three parts: two orthogonal light-controlled systems, the QS system which is designed for bi-directional communication, and the toxin/antitoxin system that can regulate the amount and ratio of the bacteria. We also develop the matching software to help the users apply our system. In the future, we envision our bacteria co-culture system being applied in the fermentation and other related microbial engineering.",

Existing therapeutic strategies cannot keep pace with the rapid progression of antibiotic resistance. To combat this challenge, innovative approaches must be developed.In collaboration with our local hospital, we have designed a plasmid-based CRISPR/Cas-system targeting antibiotic resistance in pathogenic strains of E. coli. This system is delivered using an E. coli vehicle, which transfers the plasmid to the target in the gastrointestinal tract by bacterial conjugation. Thus, our system can be used to sensitize pathogens to antibiotics.We believe that antibiotic resistance cannot be resolved by scientific solutions alone. Therefore, we aim to provide future generations with tools to creatively solve this global challenge. For this purpose, we have collaborated with students and teachers to develop a 5E model-based teaching material to supplement the Danish high school curriculum.",

Sharks` liver oil is the richest natural origin of squalene. However, this origin is limited because of epidemic marine pollution, overfishing of sharks and the international concern on shark protection.The goal of this research is to produce squalene using E.coli, the most common microbial factory. To achieve this, we need to introduce exogenous squalene synthase (SQS) into E.coli.Firstly, we compared the yield using SQSs from different species. To facilitate this, CrtN, turning colorless squalene into yellow ß-carotene, is introduced. Secondly, an exogenous MVA pathway is introduced and a more effective MEP pathway is developed via overexpression of key regulatory enzymes. Both pathways produce the precursor of squalene in E.coli and eventually improve the squalene yield.This research provides an alternative to squalene production, bringing positive effects on shark protection.",

In this project, we propose and demonstrate molecular computation models for basic arithmetic operations in artificial neural networks, based on which we synthesize basic neural networks with DNA reactions. We developed a webpage tool that generates DNA reactions and relevant DNA sequences according to the required parameters of neural networks.

		"abstract": "As a significant tool in biological research, CRISPR`s potential has not been fully exploited, and the off-target problems remain unsolved. Concerning this, we aim at optimizing CRISPR system in two aspects: developing in-situ detection of off-target and novel biostorage.The real-time monitor of off-target is basically composed of a lure sequence, derived from off-target possibility predictions with the Markov model, and a quick-response reporter system based on split luciferase. Luminescence is displayed upon dCas9`s binding to lure sequence using luciferase complementary assay. Our biostorage is based on CRISPR acquisition. Signal initiates Cas1/2 to insert protospacer into CRISPR array, further moving the predesigned stop codon out of frame and EGFP into the ORF. When applied with Galois fields, information can be stored in binary format with optimal fault tolerance. In summary, our project provides an off-target control and a novel application for CRISPR.",

Specifically, we developed Directed Chassis-agnostic Evolution, or DiCE, a novel, easy-to-implement selection-based directed evolution platform built off Qbeta replicase, an RNA-based RNA polymerase, capable of evolving proteins in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we generated standard selection schema compatible with PREDCEL (Heidelberg 2017) to expand the range of synthetic biological parts that can be created by any SSS.

Harmless bacteria are used as vehicle for phages, which will remain integrated in the bacterial DNA through the lysogenic cycle. Using our genetically modified switch, the lytic cycle is triggered once the vehicle has reached the site of infection, releasing a high dose of localized bacteriophages, ready to infect pathogenic bacteria.

Our purpose is to detect the presence of microcystin, a hepatotoxin produced by Microcystis aeruginosa under certain conditions. Microcystin is synthesized nonribosomally via microcystin synthetase encoded by the mcy genes. We have constructed plasmids where, after the promoter region, mcy genes are replaced with GFP genes. We would like to transform the plasmids into M. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli using shuttle plasmids. Upon addition of the transformed bacteria to wild-type M. aeruginosa cultures, we expect that the inserted GFP genes will be transcribed due to cell-to-cell communication. By taking samples from the growing cultures, we can determine the algae concentration which microcystin starts to be produced at. For further studies, since its sequence is unknown, we are going to sequence the promoter of mcy genes of Microcystis flos-aquae, another species abundant in Hungarian lakes.",

RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism in eukaryotic organisms, in which sequence specific gene silencing is triggered by the introduction of dsRNA. In this project, we used RNAi technology to silence the genes encoding proteins with essential functions to induce mortality in Mikania micrantha Kunth through topical application of E Coli expressed RNAi molecules. In the meantime, we have developed a synthetic kit that can be used to synthesize RNAi nanoparticles of different sizes, and a siRNA sifting program for other researchers to select RNAi molecules for their specific purpose.",

A potential alternative to chemical fertilizers is rhizobia, a microorganism that takes nitrogen from the air and converts it into nitrates. The nitrates can then be readily used by the host legume and surrounding organisms after the legume decays. Current challenges in the use of rhizobia in agriculture include desiccation, bacterial competition, and other osmotic stressors. Our project works to improve rhizobia`s agricultural capabilities through overexpression of a gene involved in trehalose biosynthesis, otsA. Expected benefits include increased nitrogenase activity, increased tolerance to environmental stressors, and increased crop yield of associated legumes. This next-generation of rhizobia will be a stepping stone to transforming agricultural practices to be both economically and ecologically sustainable.",

A major safety concern associated with this design is inevitable, potentially detrimental, basal off-target expression of genes of interest. To obviate this risk we have created LoGENEgate, an entirely new AND gate apparatus based on mRNA trans-splicing.

Our software, Pathlab, perfectly caters to this demand with accurate and efficient algorithms and open data in the KEGG and BRENDA databases. Considering thermodynamic feasibility, material competition of heterogeneous reactions and toxicity of intermediates, Pathlab constructs an optimal synthetic pathway in E. coli or the yeast which is based on the available substrates or desired products. Meanwhile, the enzyme required for each reaction in the pathway will be selected first according to thephysical and chemical properties and the affinity with biological chassis, and then be provided after optimization by codon preference. Moreover, Pathlab provides additional functions, such as word clouds for keywords of pathway-related literature, search engine for promoters and parts used in iGEM，etc.",

		"abstract": "Plastic pollution is a large-scale environmental burden. An economy of single-use plastics, commonly made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) due to its high crystallinity and resistance to degradation, has led to the production of millions of tons of plastic that is improperly disposed. Remarkably, an enzyme produced by Ideonella sakaiensis, termed PETase, can degrade this polymer at ambient temperatures. Combining the recent mutations derived from Austin et al., (2018) to increase the catalytic activity of PETase, our goal is to further optimize the thermostability and catalytic ability of PETase, through targeted mutagenesis, creating sequences using rational design and machine learning algorithms. With further optimization, we believe PETase may offer an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution to industrial plastic recycling efforts. Moreover, as the byproducts of PET degradation, terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), are valuable feedstocks for PET production, this approach offers the possibility of close-loop recycling.",

		"abstract": "The consumption of red meat has been linked to atherosclerosis, a form of heart disease caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries. Recently, it was discovered that the combination of choline and L-carnitine from red meat are converted to trimethylamine (TMA) in the body. TMA is a precursor to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is found to exacerbate cholesterol buildup, ultimately leading to atherosclerosis. In this study, we targeted this pathway by breaking down the precursor, TMA, before TMAO is formed. A system designed to concurrently degrade TMA and subdue its toxic by-product, formaldehyde, was implemented in E. coli for these purposes. This system is composed of Trimethylamine Dehydrogenase (TMADH) and Formaldehyde Dehydrogenase (FDH) which are being tested independently for their degradation properties. Our approach has proven that TMADH is effective in TMA degradation and FDH can be expressed in a bacterial vector to minimize the presence of formaldehyde.",

We demonstrated two applications of PhASE: Firstly, by driving enzymes and substrates in and out of a phase, we could control the overall efficiency of enzymatic reactions. Secondly, since some proteins only phase-separate at one end of a cell, we explored the potentiality of this system for cell heterogeneity induction with high time resolution. Additionally, we tried to explain the pattern of phase formed in E.coli using morphologically engineered cell lines.

Early diagnosis of AD is critical for proper disease management and accelerating AD research. Our team proposes the development of a panel of antibodies to diagnose Alzheimer`s disease years before its onset by detecting immunologic changes in peripheral blood. We will construct an in vitro model of AD by exposing microglia cells co-cultured with beta amyloid to T-cells. Using a phage display library of random sequences, we will obtain phage binding profiles for these T-cells. This profile will be processed using an algorithm based on amino acid structural similarity clustering to identify antibody sequences that can distinguish between normal T-cells and T-cells exposed to Alzheimer`s neurons. Deep learning segmentation and antibody epitope prediction will then be used to identify the most probable proteins and pathways that these antibody sequences target.",

Several strategies have been employed to create targeted drug therapies which are able to effectively destroy cancerous cells while minimising effects on healthy ones. These include using antibodies and various types of polymer or lipid based nanoparticles. However, often such treatments are expensive, require substantial post-production modifications, or have stability issues. Encapsulins are highly stable, cheap, bacterially produced nano-compartments. We genetically fused HER2 targeting peptides to the encapsulins` surface, and loaded them with photosensitisers, proteins which are able to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon illumination with a specific wavelength of light, to create a double selection targeted drug delivery vehicle. When introduced into the bloodstream, the encapsulins would travel to the tumor site, specifically bind to cancerous HER2 expressing cells, and will begin producing toxic ROS when illuminated - destroying only the cancerous cells.",

An inducible expression system that can isolate aflatoxin affected crops was engineered using the Gal4/UAS system and single-chain variable fragments (ScFvs). Gal4 is a transcriptional factor that binds to an upstream activating sequence (UAS), which in turn drives the expression of a downstream gene. The primary gene of interest was BS3, an apoptotic initiator derived from C. annuum. The binding and activating domains of Gal4 were each fused to a unique ScFv that is specific to AFB1. Upon exposure to AFB1, each ScFv will bind to AFB1 and allow Gal4 to induce indirect expression of BS3. All in all, the Gal4/UAS system is a novel idea in the field of plant pathology and holds great potential to enhance peanut production within Georgia.",

With Fluosphera, we aim to improve in vitro drug testing by reducing the reliance on animal experimentation, as well as increasing the efficiency and accuracy of drug screening.",

		"abstract": "We are developing glutamate and GABA bacterial biosensors by modifying the iGluSnFr and iGABASnFr proteins developed by Marvin et al. (2013, 2019). These proteins consist of a domain that binds the target ligand and an associated fluorescent domain that becomes activated upon binding. The original sensors developed by Marvin et al. also contain sequences to facilitate expression on the surface of mammalian cells. We intend to modify these by replacing the eukaryotic localisation signal and transmembrane anchor with bacterial equivalents. To this end we have selected the truncated from of a bacterial Ice Nucleation Protein that acts as both a membrane anchor and a localisation signal.The motivation for producing these biosensors is to produce a proof of concept system for cheaply measuring serum GABA and Glut concentrations in a clinical context, since the ratio of these two biomarkers is diagnostic of early neurological deterioration following a stroke.",

It is obtained by debarking the yew tree species (Taxus Baccata), or through semi-synthesis from rare precursors in the tree`s needles. Both of these processes are unsustainable and contribute to the expensive production costs.Our project aims to address this in two ways. First, to enhance the rate of product formation by attaching rate-limiting enzymes of Paclitaxel semi-synthesis onto a hexameric protein scaffold called `Assemblase`. This spatial arrangement co-localises the enzymes, alleviating diffusion-related limitations of enzyme catalysis.The second component applies `Assemblase` to make the production of Paclitaxel from common analogues commercially viable. This reduces the need to log the yew tree, and lower reagent costs. In addition, the system allows for the recycling of co-products produced between the two pathways. Overall, our project aims to improve upon Paclitaxel manufacturing to meet the demands of the future.",

This project aims to generate a multi-enzyme system, based on characteristics of wood-decaying fungi, to efficiently process lignin into high-value chemicals. To achieve this, Pichia pastoris is engineered to express horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO). HRP degrades lignin under consumption of hydrogen peroxide. AAO, in turn, utilises parts of the degradation products to create more hydrogen peroxide, forming a self-sustaining system.

Through our human practices, potential users were reticent about using engineered live microbes and since hexavalent chromium is toxic to bacteria, we set out to develop a cell-free system which includes the repressor, ChrB, that binds to the chromium promoter ChrP. In the presence of hexavalent chromium, ChrB is released from ChrP, allowing for the expression of a reporter gene. We explore the use of two different reporter genes: a green fluorescent protein, and a bacterial flavin-containing monooxygenase, an enzyme that results in visible indigo production.

These features open new possibilities in research on how protein expression dynamics affect the operation of a synthetic circuit.To realize the potential of optogenetics in bacteria, we have created a three-level light-controlled system for dynamic bacterial control.

		"abstract": "A devastating plant-pathogen, Xylella fastidiosa, is spreading through the Mediterranean. This pathogen is wiping out economically important crops, including olives and grapevine, with no effective cure found yet. Currently, the containment methods for this disease are pre-emptively burning trees and using high doses of pesticides. Our team, Xylencer, develops an effective solution for this disease by using bacteriophage therapy for X. fastidiosa. To overcome current limitations, including UV degradation of bacteriophages, we design a protective carrier bacterium that produces bacteriophages upon sensing X. fastidiosa. Bacteriophages will lyse the bacteria, while simultaneously triggering a plant immune response with specific peptides, forming an alliance between plant and bacteriophage. In order to have the bacteriophage spread to all infected plants, we mimic X. fastidiosa`s spread by fusing chitin-binding proteins to the bacteriophage capsid, facilitating their spread by insects. Using our modular approach Xylencer, we believe we can eradicate X. fastidiosa.",

We propose combining chemically induced dimerization (CID), in which two proteins dimerize only in the presence of a ligand, with a traditional luciferase assay to create a biosensor that luminesces when the desired molecule is introduced. Using molecule-specific nanobodies, we can design the two CID binders to attach to a wide variety of small molecules, even those that are challenging for conventional biosensors to detect. Through its specificity and ability to bind to small or hydrophobic molecules, the CID system overcomes problems that other biosensors face. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented an in vivo CID biosensor to detect the presence of cannabidiol. With the nanobody CID system, we hope to introduce a novel biosensor that can detect a variety of important small molecules across research, biotechnology, and medicine.",

These microorganisms form root nodules and fix nitrogen gas into ammonia, which plants need to grow.Farmers using herbicides that interfere with biological nitrogen fixation need to apply more nitrogen fertilizers. The runoff from these fertilizers causes nutrient pollution. Therefore, we aim to minimize the use of nitrogen fertilizers. To do this, we are engineeringBradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA110 to have the ability to form root nodules with soybeans in the presence of the herbicide linuron.

Our project harnesses these properties to repurpose biofilms as robust, spatially controlled, patterned, and responsive biomaterials. For robustness, we engineered a library of biofilm-strengthening adhesins, and investigated naturally biofilm-forming bacterial species. To adhere biofilms with precise spatiotemporal control, we incorporated both optogenetic and chemical induction methods. To pattern biomaterials once placed, we utilized the distance-dependent diffusion of quorum signaling molecules and generated Turing patterns that are informed by mathematical modeling. Our biomaterials have immediate applications in wound healing, water and waste treatment, and the creation of next-generation biosensors.",

Additionally, a primary hardware has been built to realize our design with the prevention the bacterial leakage and nutrients supplementation, coupled with another software for device control.",

		"abstract": "Bacterial biofilms present significant medical challenges. A key component of biofilm formation in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl, which are involved in the formation and maintenance of the structural biofilm scaffold and protection against antimicrobials and host defenses.So, we used synthetic biology methods to overexpress the hydrolyzing enzyme that decomposes the corresponding extracelluar polysaccharide in engineering bacteria to destroy the wild type P. aeruginosa biofilm. Since the extracellular polysaccharide hydrolase is an instracellular enzyme and can`t be secreted into the extracellular environment, this project designed two protocols to induce the engineering bacteria to cleave, thereby releasing the extracellular polysaccharide hydroalase into the extracellular environment and destroying the wild biofilm.We hope to solve problems of antibiotic resistance caused by biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in clinical treatment , and provide a new idea for eradication of chronic bacteria infection.",

		"abstract": "The incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in China has continued to rise. To solve the problem, our team designed and manufactured a set of household HPV detector for HPV early screening. Our detector will use female menstrual blood as teat sample and support two detection methods. The first method is based on CRISPR/Cas system. After rupturing the cervical epithelial cells in menstrual blood, we amplified the target with RPA, then identified it with Cas12a protein. This method is highly specific and can be used for HPV typing. However, in HPV screening, the key is to detect multiple HPV subtypes simultaneously. Therefore, to implement multi-channel detection, we designed another method. It uses ExoⅢ to assist signal amplification and uses hybridization chain reaction to further amplify the signal. Both methods report the result using test paper. We have also designed three versions of PaDetector to better meet user needs.",

		"abstract": "Formaldehyde is a serious threat to human health while it almost exists everywhere especially in newly decorated rooms. This year, our team focus on the degradation of formaldehyde using E. coli. Our genetically engineered bacteria contain three parts: the degradation device、the indication device and the photolysis device. The degradation device acting as the core turns formaldehyde into carbon dioxide with several protein. At the same time, the indication device shows users if the concentration of formaldehyde is safe to live. When the concentration is higher than a threshold value, the medium gives a blue color, otherwise it appears orange. In consideration ofbiosafety, we integrate a photolysis system which expresses lysin protein when exposed under blue light, thus our HCHO-scavenger works in the dark. The lysed bacteria can be recycled in the end.",
