The physical manifestation of a Part is a special DNA sequence called a \"BioBrick standard biological part\". There are variety of BioBrick plasmids that contain one or more Parts, but all have fundamentally the same design: all contain an antibiotic resistance gene (a selector), an origin of replication, perhaps some other things, and the actual Part that has \"BioBrick ends.\" The BioBrick ends consist of specific patterns of restriction sites which bracket the Part in a standard way, so that this section of the plasmid is always organized in the following manner: EcoRI - XbaI - INSERT - SpeI - PstI, where INSERT designates the actual functional Part (e.g., the Lux operon). It is essential that these four particular restriction sites occur only once -- and in the given order -- in the plasmid because their standard organization and single occurrence in each BioBrick enables the modularity and composability of the Parts. Hence the INSERT - the Part - must not contain any of the four restriction sites.

Our work was done in collaboration with the Davidson College iGEM team. The Burnt Pancake Problem The pancake problem is a puzzle in which a scrambled series of units (or stack of pancakes) must be shuffled into the correct order and orientation. In the burnt pancake problem, each pancake is given an orientation by burning one side. The The leftmost stack in Figure 1 below shows a scrambled stack of burnt pancakes. To solve the problem, every unit, or pancake, must be placed in the proper order (largest on bottom, smallest on top) and in the proper orientation (burnt side down, golden side up). The pancakes are flipped with two spatulas: one to lift pancakes off the top of the stack (if needed), the other to flip part (or all) of the remaining stack of pancakes. The pancakes lifted by the first spatula are returned to the top of the stack without being flipped. The illustration below shows that this stack of pancakes can be put into correct order and orientation in three such steps. One can verify that no two allowable flips are sufficient.

It has been highly controversial whether some patterns observed in several organisms are of this type. In particular, although some systems have been identified to be of activator-inhibitor type (the most popular Turing system proposed by Gierer and Meindhart), it is still questioned if pattern formation and more generally, the appearance of functional structures can be understood by means of Turing patterns or more broadly, reaction-diffusion mechanims.

We propose that if the appropriate genetic construction is implanted in a colony of bacteria, the reaction-diffusion mechanism can be replaced by a genetic control system.

Neurotransmitters are chemical compounds which relay messages between neurons and other cells through the stimulation of action potentials.

Once the neurotransmitter activates the receptor on the post-synaptic cell, an action potential based on chemical and electrical gradients is triggered and propogates through the axon to the cell body and the dendrites. When the action potential reaches the cell body and the dendrites of the receiving neuron, the same neurotransmitter is usually released and the electrical message is carried further along the pathway of neurons.

The combination of these chemical pathways is predicted to increase the level of butanol production. Our second project, the Bacterial Etch-a-Sketch, features a complex network of gene expression and repression that enables a lawn of bacteria to respond to 470nm light.

Furthermore, the American Farm School in Thessaloniki was founded to educate young men and women in agriculture and life science, thus the students from this school have practical training in this area. The key factor to having healthy soil is the presence of a plethora of different bacterial species. There are millions of different types of bacteria in nutritious soil. These bacteria do everything from decomposing dead matter to simple carbons or degrading pollutants to forming nitrogen-fixing, mutualistic relationships with plants. We can take advantage of the roots that exists at the American Farm School by working with the different soils and their equipment. We first plan to take soil samples from different areas at the farm. We will analyze the different bacterial and chemical composition of the soils in relation to the crops that are being grown in the area. Then we will identify the beneficial properties of the existing types of bacteria to see which would be most beneficial to express on a large-scale. We plan to focus on nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These microorganisms are called diazotrophs and are extremely important to the environment. They convert nitrogen (N2) in the atmosphere to ammonia (NH3). This allows the nitrogen to be easily used as a biological building block. Many of these bacteria form relationships with plants where the plant supply carbons and the bacteria supply the nitrogen for plants to use in growth.

It was identified that VL region showed higher affinity for p53 than VHH, and dimerization of VL regions increases their affinity up to ten folds. Camelid antibodies can be conjugated to other proteins without loss of function. They can be expressed and secreted in such common model organism as E. coli, reducing the cost of antibody production.

Our team is using synthetic biology to develop a more affordable, portable, and accessible means of testing. We designed a plasmid that uses ArsR, a negative transcriptional repressor, to regulate the expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). In the presence of arsenic, ArsR will undergo a conformational change that allows GFP expression. The assay is performed using a low cost paper ticket made by Edgewood Chemical Biological Center and analyzed with ultraviolet light. The development of this circuit would provide an inexpensive way to evaluate arsenic contamination.", "medal": "Bronze", "title": "Affordable, Paper-based Assay For Detection Of Arsenic Contamination", "nomination": "-", "award": "-", "parts_link": "http://parts.igem.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2017&group=Cadets2Vets", "wiki_link": "http://2017.igem.org/Team:Cadets2Vets", "region": "North America"}, {"team_name": "Calgary", "institution": "University of Calgary", "location": "Canada", "track": "Manufacturing", "year": "2017", "section": "Undergrad", "abstract": "Governments and private enterprises alike are gearing up for exploration and colonization of Mars.

To tackle the situation, we succeeded in the development of the serotype prediction system using stochastic process analysis. This system can predict the patient's serotype by simulating the past data. We also developed the simple and fast testing kit that can detect serotype with fluorescence, so that we can check the patient easily and get enough data to estimate the patients' serotypes more accurate.

Considering thermodynamic feasibility, material competition of heterogeneous reactions and toxicity of intermediates, Pathlab constructs an optimal synthetic pathway in E. coli or the yeast which is based on the available substrates or desired products. Meanwhile, the enzyme required for each reaction in the pathway will be selected first according to thephysical and chemical properties and the affinity with biological chassis, and then be provided after optimization by codon preference.

An economy of single-use plastics, commonly made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) due to its high crystallinity and resistance to degradation, has led to the production of millions of tons of plastic that is improperly disposed. Remarkably, an enzyme produced by Ideonella sakaiensis, termed PETase, can degrade this polymer at ambient temperatures. Combining the recent mutations derived from Austin et al., (2018) to increase the catalytic activity of PETase, our goal is to further optimize the thermostability and catalytic ability of PETase, through targeted mutagenesis, creating sequences using rational design and machine learning algorithms. With further optimization, we believe PETase may offer an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution to industrial plastic recycling efforts.

Thus, the degradation of azo dyes has become an urgent problem.At present, physical and chemical treatments have been applied to deal with the azo dyes in waste water. Both of the two ways are suffering from the disadvantages of low decolourization ratio, high cost and additional pollution.Our project focuses on ulteriorly improving the decolourization ability of Shewanella oneidensis by introducing NAT enzyme to help resist the byproduct toxicity and overexpressing electron transfer proteins.

At the early stage of neurodegenerative disease, the overstimulation-led neuronal injury, or excitatoxicity has an high risk to induce degeneration of neurons. In the extracellular matrix of CNS, the uncontrolled over-high concentration of glutamate, as a primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter, is common in the cases of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we chose an mRNA which codes the glutamate transporter that generally expressed on the surface of mammals` glial cells, the Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 (EAAT2), to be enclosed in exosomes, which are designed to carry the therapeutic `cargo` to pass the BBB. The EAAT2 will be translated in the glial cells, and increase the efficiency of glutamate clearance as a useful method in the early treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.", "medal": "Gold", "nomination": "-", "award": "-", "parts_link": "http://parts.igem.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2019&group=XJTLU-CHINA", "wiki_link": "https://2019.igem.org/Team:XJTLU-CHINA", "year": "2019"}, {"team_name": "XJTU-CHINA", "institution": "Xi`an Jiaotong University", "location": "China", "region": "Asia", "track": "New Application", "section": "Undergrad", "title": "Bacterial Fragrance Generator", "abstract": "Nowadays an increasing number of people worldwide are suffering various sleep-related problems.

Firstly, glucose was converted to the shared precursor of these two molecules by a precursor-producing plasmid. Secondly, the thermosensitive protein CI and red-light-controlled switching elements in the fragrance-producing plasmid enabled the conversion of the precursor to limonene and linalool alternatively, leading to the synthesis of linalool at night for a sound sleep, while the synthesis of limonene in the morning to remove sleepy mind.

Since the extracellular polysaccharide hydrolase is an instracellular enzyme and can`t be secreted into the extracellular environment, this project designed two protocols to induce the engineering bacteria to cleave, thereby releasing the extracellular polysaccharide hydroalase into the extracellular environment and destroying the wild biofilm.We hope to solve problems of antibiotic resistance caused by biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in clinical treatment , and provide a new idea for eradication of chronic bacteria infection.", "medal": "Silver", "nomination": "-", "award": "-", "parts_link": "http://parts.igem.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2019&group=YAU-China", "wiki_link": "https://2019.igem.org/Team:YAU-China", "year": "2019"}, {"team_name": "ZJU-China", "institution": "Zhejiang University", "location": "China", "region": "Asia", "track": "Diagnostics", "section": "Undergrad", "title": "PaDetector, a household device for HPV preliminary screening", "abstract": "The incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in China has continued to rise. To solve the problem, our team designed and manufactured a set of household HPV detector for HPV early screening.

After rupturing the cervical epithelial cells in menstrual blood, we amplified the target with RPA, then identified it with Cas12a protein. This method is highly specific and can be used for HPV typing. However, in HPV screening, the key is to detect multiple HPV subtypes simultaneously. Therefore, to implement multi-channel detection, we designed another method. It uses Exo\u2162 to assist signal amplification and uses hybridization chain reaction to further amplify the signal.

The degradation device acting as the core turns formaldehyde into carbon dioxide with several protein. At the same time, the indication device shows users if the concentration of formaldehyde is safe to live. When the concentration is higher than a threshold value, the medium gives a blue color, otherwise it appears orange.
